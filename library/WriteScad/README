Description
===========

UPDATED: 04/24/2013 M_G pointed out that space didn't work properly on
writecube.. (fixed) Thanks M_G!!

UPDATED: 03/06/2013 Added Help file for creating fonts.
I have looked everywhere for an easy way to write on my 3d objects. Everything
I could find was hard to manipulate, so I decided to give it a shot myself.
Hope you like this as much as I do. I'll try to answer any questions you have.

write.scad Routines:
write()
writecube()
writesphere()
writecylinder()
writecircle()

Fonts:
letters.dxf (change in write.scad)
orbitron.dxf
braille.dxf
knewave.dxf
BlackRose.dxf
-------------------------
writecylinder specs in testwritecylinder.scad
-------------------------
Be glad to add more fonts if requested, or give details to make your own. 


Instructions
============

openscad version 2011.12 or later is required to be able to run this code. Be
sure to download the latest version from http://openscad.org/

Put the files (write.scad) and (letters.dfx) in
the working directory with your open scad project.
refrence write.scad in your code...(use)

NOTE: write.scad contains write(),writesphere(),writecube() and writecylinder()
modules

// write anywhere in your openscad project
locate([x,y,z])
write("Hello World",h=6,t=3);

// change fonts and spacing
write("Hello World",h=6,t=3,font="knewave.dxf",space=1.1);

// write on a cube
translate([15,15,15])
cube([20,20,10]);
writecube("Hello World",[15,15,15],[20,20,10],face="top");

// write on a sphere
translate([15,15,15])
sphere(12);
writesphere("Hello World",[15,15,15],12);

// write on a cylinder
translate([0,0,0])
cylinder(r=20,h=40,center=true);
writecylinder("Text on Cylinder",[0,0,0],20,40,rotate=45,center=true);
writecylinder("Text on top",[0,0,0],20,40,face="top",center=true);
//detailed usage in testwritecylinder.scad
//be sure to download the latest write.scad to use the new commands

// write in circles
writecircle("text",[0,0,0],radius);
